# UCB: Tableau Homework

I chose to look at CitiBike data for March 2018, March 2019, and March 2020.  Given the shelter in place that went into effect March 20th, 2020 in NYC, I was curious to see if it affected the number of CitiBike trips.

## How Does Day & Time Affect Trips?

You are able to sort graphs by a variety of filters, but in the case of the top graph "Most Popular Day", the most interesting way to filter is by Year.  While there is a large difference betweeen the highest trips per day and the lowest trips per day across the whole month, it does not seem to be related to the Day.  However, when filtered by 2020, you can see that the days after the shelter in place order much fewer trips than the days before.  This is expected since fewer people are traveling around the city.

The second graph, "Most Popular Time", show expected usage spikes around rush hour on weekdays.  CitiBike has said that most of their riders use the bikes to get to and from transporation hubs (bus stops, subway stations, etc.). Like other modes of transporation, peak time is when people are headed to or from work.

## Gender & Age 

n the next panel, I've compiled charts to show how gender and age affect the number of trips, and trip duration.  There were over 3x more male riders in 2018 and 2019, though only 2.7x more in 2020 (and fewer riders of both gender overall in 2020).  However, it seem that women are consistently taking longer trips on average than men year over year.

Riders in their late 20s and early 30s account for the most trips.  However, some of this age data is questionable as there are riders recorded as being born in the 1880s, and many over the age of 100.  Those values were removed via the filter, as well as an outlier of age 51 (unless there's an extremely active group of 51 year olds rider bikes around the city hundreds of times a day).  Trip Duration seems to be less correlated with age than total number of trips.

The last chart on this panel shows how usertype has changed.  Customers are riders who have a 24-hour pass or 3-day pass, and Subscribers have an annual membership.  There are vastly more Subscribers than Customers every year, though the decrease of Subscribers in 2020 could be attributed to riders not renewing their memberships in advance of Covid-19.

## Which Stations are Most Popular?

The last panel illustrates which stations are the most popular for both starting and ending trips.  Pershing Square North, the most popular station, is closest to Grand Central Terminal.  Other popular stations are likewise close to other major transporation terminals like Penn Station or Union Square.  From the map you can see that Manhattan is the most popular borough by far, and has them most stations out of all the boroughs.
